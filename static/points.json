I graduated from my BSc top of the class - in part due to my <a href='http://rawgisdata.s3.amazonaws.com/jessroberts/Final_Draft.pdf' target='_blank'>dissertation</a> which included my first comprehensive GIS analysis. This work inspired me to specialise in geospatial data and to undertake the university's MSc in GIS for which I was awarded a Distinction.
